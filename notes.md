# Notes

- Change this repo from being just about this project to being about the entire project ecosystem.
- The current design is working towards just restaurants but the system could be expanded to work with the hospitality industry as a whole. 
- The unified ingredient inventory could work alongside the product streaming system that I was planning on using as a source of materials for the boxes. This system would work well with a "hospitality" coin, an offshoot of the BASIC Foundation (BSIC). The original idea was to have all narrow coins minted using the base resource, but maybe it would be fine to have it minted using BSIC instead. That would give BSIC additional demand and value from the hospitality industry, so the hospitality industry would be, in a way, subsidizing basic needs, as it should be. 
- To that point, regarding stipends for learning and volunteering to be educators that should be limited to base level foundations that support core issues. The higher up we go, the shift will be to foundations managing guilds to provide educaiton.
