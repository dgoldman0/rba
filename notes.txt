The unified ingredient inventory could work alongside the product streaming system that I was planning on using as a source of materials for the boxes. This system would work well with a "hospitality" coin, an offshoot of the BASIC Foundation (BSIC). The original idea was to have all narrow coins minted using the base resource, but maybe it would be fine to have it minted using BSIC instead. That would give BSIC additional demand and value from the hospitality industry, so the hospitality industry would be, in a way, subsidizing basic needs, as it should be.
